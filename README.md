Dependently typed Quantum Information stuff.

# Status

At the moment these are just partially scalayified notes based on [Q is for Quantum](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Q-Quantum-Terry-Rudolph/dp/0999063502/) (a new introductory book by my tutor at university)

The hope is to be able to find an acceptable representation of Quantum Information ideas which I'll use in other work
